100 Days of Python challenge! 🎉

📌 About
I am committing to coding in Python for 100 consecutive days to learn, practice, and improve my skills. Every day, I will share:

A new Python project 💻

Useful tips I discover along the way 🔍

🎯 Goals
✔ Strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals\n
✔ Work on real-world projects and problem-solving\n
✔ Share knowledge and learn from the community\n

📂 Daily Projects
Each project will be uploaded to this repository under a daily folder (e.g., Day 1, Day 2, ...). Feel free to explore them, try them out, and modify them for your own learning.
